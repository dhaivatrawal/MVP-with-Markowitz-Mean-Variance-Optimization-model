# MVP Markowitz Mean Variance Optimization model

The project focuses on implementing the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization model, a cornerstone of modern portfolio theory, using Python alongside advanced libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Gurobi for solving optimization problems. It explores various optimization scenarios by imposing different constraints on expected returns and portfolio weights.

Initially, the model begins with a basic setup where the expected return is fixed precisely at a given value. Subsequently, it extends to more complex scenarios where the expected return is constrained to be at least a specified value or where portfolios are allowed to include short-selling positions.

The documentation accompanying the project provides meticulous explanations of each constraint's implications. It elucidates how these constraints influence the construction of the efficient frontier, which represents the set of optimal portfolios balancing risk and return. Moreover, it analyzes how varying constraints alter the composition and characteristics of the optimal portfolio.

Complementing the theoretical insights, the project includes practical implementations through annotated code examples. These examples demonstrate how the optimization model is instantiated and solved using Python and Gurobi, showcasing the step-by-step process from data input to generating optimal portfolios under different constraints.

Furthermore, the project incorporates visualizations that depict the outcomes of the optimization process. These visual aids include plots of the efficient frontier under various constraint scenarios, allowing stakeholders to intuitively grasp the trade-offs between risk and return and to identify the optimal portfolio strategies corresponding to different investment objectives.

In summary, this project integrates theoretical foundations with practical applications in portfolio optimization, leveraging Python's capabilities alongside specialized libraries to explore and illustrate diverse optimization scenarios through detailed documentation, code implementations, and insightful visualizations.
